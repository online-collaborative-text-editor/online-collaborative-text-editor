// The listener will be called whenever that event is emitted by any client.
// For example, io.on('connection', callback) sets up a listener for the 'connection' event,
// which is emitted whenever a client connects to the server.

// socket.on:
// This is used to set up a listener for a specific event on a specific socket.
// The listener will be called whenever that event is emitted by the client associated with that socket.
// For example, socket.on('disconnect', callback) sets up a listener for the 'disconnect' event,
// which is emitted when the client associated with the socket disconnects.

// io.emit:
// This is used to emit an event to all connected clients.

// socket.emit:
// This is used to emit an event to the client associated with that socket.

// io.to.emit:
// This is used to emit an event to all clients in a specific room.

// socket.to.emit:
// This is used to emit an event to all clients in a specific room, excluding the client associated with the socket.
